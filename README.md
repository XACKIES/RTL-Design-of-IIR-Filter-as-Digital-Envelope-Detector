# RTL-Design-of-IIR-Filter-as-Digital-Envelope-Detector
This project implements a digital envelope detector in Verilog HDL, designed for extracting the amplitude envelope of an input signal. The module uses a single-pole low-pass filter (exponential moving average) with a tunable smoothing factor ALPHA in Q1.15 fixed-point format.
